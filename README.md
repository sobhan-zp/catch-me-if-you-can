# Catch Me If You Can

## About

Catch Me If You Can is an Android game app. The motive for creating the game was to make the dull experience of trying to meet up with friends a fun experience. The app features: user accounts, customisable user profiles, text chat, Google Maps integration, in-app notifications, and basic augmented reality.

The team also decided to tackle making this app through Agile methodology with 3 major milestones, tracking assignments and responsibilities through [Zenhub](zenhub.com). 

A highly detailed requirements document of the application explaining the target users, product description, and a detailed list of features and how they should work: **https://goo.gl/WPsNSg**
